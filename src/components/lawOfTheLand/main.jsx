              When you hold a Little King it isn't just a representation of
              yourself physically, but it is a way to represent your religion of
              life, your belief system, and your way of living through the day
              to day. We want people with a similar mindset. The Little Kings
              are filling the kingdom with individuals who don't just speak
              words into the atmosphere, but bring them to life through action
              and execution. In a world filled with people who make empty
              promises and take little to no action, The Kingdom is a heaven for
              free thinkers who are committed to putting in the work necessary
              to see their dreams come to life no matter the cost.

              Being a Little King means being a part of an ecosystem where you
              can thrive off a synergy between other creators and executors no
              matter where you reside in the world. The kingdom is the ultimate
              bridge between blockchains, a hub of both worlds looking to grab
              the best talent from each network to form the most inclusive and
              diverse community. The kingdom is a space where education reigns
              supreme with an atmosphere of love and support between our fellow
              kings.

              The Little Kings is a PFP passion project on the Solana network.
              It is the ultimate representation for creatives, executors, and
              dreamers. The collection consists of 6,666 little kings that will
              grant you access to a kingdom full of leaders and creators that
              continue to push the envelope in every single aspect of life,
              mentally, physically and spiritually.

                  Freedom is not the ability to move from one place to the
                  other. Freedom is expressing yourself with no restrained forms
                  of judgment and criticism. It is living your truth while being
                  embraced by the ones closest to you. The kingdom is exactly
                  that, a place of peace where you can become your highest self
                  while being supported by those around you with the ability to
                  grow and learn from others. The kingdom is a place that
                  provides the tools and connections necessary to give everyone
                  the opportunity to further their abilities and make a name for
                  themselves in web 3.

                  Power is more than just a physical trait. Real power comes
                  from the act of striving forward when resistance is at its
                  highest. Real power comes from being able to say yes when the
                  world tells you no. Real power comes from the ability to not
                  be shaken by anything and stand on who you are. Someone who is
                  truly powerful is able to walk into any room and regardless of
                  the level of influence, their heart doesn't change. True power
                  comes from within because even a giant can look into a mirror
                  and still see nothing. The kingdom welcomes those who wish to
                  tap into that power and use it with grace.

                  The truth is we live in a world where the majority of us lack
                  the one thing that allows us to see our dreams come to
                  fruition. Without it we are put in states of confusion
                  ultimately leading us down a path of mediocrity. The key is
                  self love. Self love comes from being able to accept who you
                  are and the way you are. Acceptance and self love is the root
                  of our kingdom. No matter your color, sexuality, or religion,
                  one fact will never change, we are all humans, The Little
                  Kings kingdom has a zero tolerance for hate in any way shape
                  or form. It is only in love that a community can truly prosper
                  and become the best version of itself. The Kingdom welcomes
                  everyone with open arms and a fresh perspective. Note: There
                  is no higher form of acceptance than accepting oneself.
